I was often confused back in middle/high school math class. It seemed like many of the "rules" decreed by the all-powerful mathematicians were completely unnecessary.

For example, the idea that $3-2 = 3 + (-2)$. This seemed just needlessly complicating the simple idea of subtraction. Saying, "Oh no no, silly student. Subtraction is simply adding a negative number!"

This seemed completely useless. But whatever. I let it slide and didn't question it deeply enough to actually get an answer.

Until today.

## What changed?

I was walking through the main street of my downtown this afternoon. It was the kind of weather so nice and beautiful that it made you feel guilty for just for even thinking of going home and tapping around on your computer in an air-conditioned room.

As I was walking, my mind was wandering from idea to idea. Eventually, it alighted on the idea of how "shouldn't" is a contraction for "should not". **Obviously.**

But as I thought about how "shouldn't" *feels* like a different kind of idea from "should not", I finally understood the distinction/equality property mathematicians draw between subtraction and addition of a negative number.

## $3-2$ is a *contraction* for $3+(-2)$

Of course they're equal! Ultimately, they express the same idea, just like "shouldn't" and "should not", even though they feel very different. And just like it's sometimes useful to remove contractions entirely from a sentence, it is also sometimes useful to rephrase $3-2$ as $3+(-2)$.

## Replacing the contraction

An example I could think of where it is helpful to "expand the contraction" of subtraction into adding a negative is the following:

The addition rule for derivatves states:

$$\text{If }h(x)=f(x)+g(x)\text{, then } h'(x)=f'(x)+g'(x)$$

Example: $f(x)=3x^2+2x\implies f'(x)=6x+2$

If you were to think of subtraction and addition as separate operation, you would need to specify *another rule*. You would need a new *subtraction rule* for derivatives, namely:

$$\text{If }h(x)=f(x)-g(x)\text{, then } h'(x)=f'(x)-g'(x)$$

However, by "expanding the contraction" by rewriting $f(x)-g(x)=f(x)+(-g(x))$, the subtraction rule is completely implied by the first rule.

## Takeaways

I think today I really grokked the importance of metaphor in understanding something new(or even something old!). I think I also learned that it's easy to think you understand something, and hard to actually fully understand it.
