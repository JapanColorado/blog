Hello! My name is Russell! I'm currently an undergraduate student at Colorado Mesa University. I am majoring in statistics and minoring in philosophy. My interests include effective altruism, rationality, philosophy, math, writing, snowboarding, playing ping pong, and exploring thrift shops with friends.

## Why I'm starting this blog

This is not my first attempt at blogging, but it is the first one I'm pretty motivated to make succeed(primarily by using [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/home)). I'm starting this blog so that I have a place to share my thoughts and summarize what I'm learning. Currently that consists of topics like statistics and math and A.I. alignment, but I'll probably end up exploring a variety of topics.

## How long will posts be?

It depends. If i have a lot to say on a subject, probably pretty long. Most of the time, they'll probably be just short summaries/take aways from what I've read. If you're really pressed for time, I'll probably [tweet](https://x.com/japancolorado) even more condensed summaries that you could look at.

## Conclusion

Besides that, I don't really know where this blog will go. But I'm really excited to start [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) more consistently. If you want to stay updated on what I write for whatever reason, there is an RSS link at the bottom next to all my socials. And...I think that's all I have to say for now!
