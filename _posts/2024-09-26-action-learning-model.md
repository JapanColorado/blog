I've bet you've heard all the usual advice already. You should be [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public), you should [write to learn](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ii4xtogen7AyYmN6B/learning-by-writing), you should [paraphrase and summarize](https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/34-learning) what you've learned, and you should use [spaced repetition](https://gwern.net/spaced-repetition) and [mneumonic devices](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/mnemonic-devices-explained) to remember what you've learned.

They're right, of course. All these things will make you learn more effectively.

But all these things are pretty hard to do. It's *much* harder to test yourself on material you haven't seen than it is to reread a section and say, "oh yeah I *totally* know this."

## What is *action*?

I call what the above advice recommends "action". Action is using your brain to do *something* with the idea you're looking at.

For example, using your brain(and body) to teach the idea of derivatives to someone is a form of action.

Another form of action could be drawing overlapping venn diagrams to understand a particular theorem of set theory.

To put it simply, action is any form of learning where you aren't just hoping an idea transmits itself from the book into your brain.

This advice to use action to learn efficiently is correct. But I it misses a key mindset shift that has helped me, if not overcome the difficulty, at least accept it. It's also guided what I do when I want to learn something well.

## A confused model

The typical model of learning is that it happens simply by encountering new information. You read something in a book, and bam, *you've learned something*.

In my experience, this model is just flat out *wrong*. It is not the prescene of new ideas that causes learning, but instead your brain's grappling with them.

Saying that learning happens as a result of reading new ideas from a page is like saying a log cabin gets constructed when you gather timber from a forest. The wood is a *prerequisite* for a log cabin, but it is not *sufficient* to merely gather wood. You also need to put in effort and **build the house**.

In the same way, reading an idea from a page can be a prerequisite for learning that idea, but the reading alone does not constitute *learning*.

So if reading doesn't make you learn something, then what does?

## All learning requires action

Action is not a support for learning. Instead, the *process* of learning is the same as action. Anything else is simply not learning as I have found useful to define it. In other words, if you are passively reading/watching/listenting, then you aren't learning, period.

Action could be as simple as mentally rephrasing ideas as you read, or as complex as writing a blog post about the new idea. Often times, the action I'm doing is as simple as struggling to fit the idea into my model of the world. There are so many different forms that action can take, and sometimes it's not even at the level of conscious attention.

A lot of the time, our brains try to fool us that we're learning(or doing action). "I'll read back through my textbook(not doing exercises or writing summaries) and I'll really be ready for my test!"

Why do our brains do this? Because action is *hard*. It's uncomfortable and it takes work, and it exposes us to being wrong and to realizing we don't *actually* understand an idea.

This makes action difficult, but that also provides a pretty good heuristic for distinguishing productive learning(action) from fake learning.

> If what you're doing to learn isn't difficult in some way, then you aren't actually *learning* the ideas.

## Drawbacks of action

This all paints a pretty rosy picture of action, but in reality it's *really hard* to learn like this. As [Neel Nanda says](https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/34-learning), "the default state of the world is that you fail to learn things well." This means that to learn well is to oppose entropy, and this necessitates effort on your part in the form of action.

Action is ***hard***. It's scary and uncertain and cognitively taxing. It's *so much easier* to just reread a chapter rather than write a summary about that chapter.

And because your brain wants you to feel good about yourself, it convinces you that both action and passivitiy are equally good ways of learning. *Your brain is wrong.*

## Mindset shift

What makes action ***unbearable*** rather than just *hard* is the unrealistic standard we hold for the level of effort learning requires. Because of our confused model, we misidentify reading a book as *internalizing its ideas*. By that ridiculously easy standard, *of course actually playing with ideas will be difficult*.

It becomes much easier to get to work and ***actually, actively learn something*** when you stop thinking that you should be able to learn it with minimal effort.

Accept that fully internalizing an idea will take a certain amount of time and effort and pain, and there is no way around it. Weigh the expected benefit of learning the concept with these costs, and then decide whether or not it's worth it.

I think even having a concept of what effective learning actually looks and feels like(painful and challenging) is *immensely valuable*. Knowing that it's *perfectly normal*, and indeed, unavoidable, for effective learning to feel this hard makes action bearable, even if it doesn't make it less painful.

## How I'm using the action-as-learning model

If I'm going to set time aside to learn, I want to make sure I'm *actually learning*. That means when I'm watching or reading something, I'm thinking of questions, paraphrasing, writing summaries, and grappling with hard ideas for long periods of time rather than just skipping over them.

In my experience, it's much harder to stay active and engaged with mediums that lean more towards passivity, such as reading and lectures.

I try to use these activities to generate a wide surface-level understanding of the ideas before switching to inherently active mediums such as writing and solving problems to actually learn the material deeply.

I also try to spend much more time with active mediums than with passive mediums so that I don't fall into the trap of passively watching content and convincing myself I understand it.

If my brain just wants the feeling of having learned something, but doesn't want to actually put in the effort to learn, then I'll do something else that's more fun. Talking to my friends is *so much better* than rereading a textbook or rewatching a lecture. I can always come back when my brain has the capacity to put in effort and ***actively learn***.

As for the difficulty of action, I still feel a deep urge to procrastinate on action. I think this aversion will decrease as I continue to actively learn consistently. I've also found that being genuinely curious about what I'm learning helps immensely.

I'm still experimenting with how to learn efficiently, but I'm glad you're taking this trip with me!
