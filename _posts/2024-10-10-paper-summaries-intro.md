An efficient method of reading research papers is the Three-Pass approach, which consists of three passes as follows:
1) Title, abstract, introduction, headings, and conclusion. Answer the 5 C’s after this. If it doesn’t interest you or otherwise fails your standards, then you can stop after this stage.
2) Read with care, but ignore details like proofs. Jot down ideas and notes in the margin(or in Zotero). Look at figures and diagrams extra closely. As you read, mark unread references as potential further reading. After this, write a summary of what you’ve read along with supporting evidence. If the paper is important to your research field or you’re particularly interested, go on to the third pass.
3) Read the paper with extreme attention to detail. Your goal is essentially to reimplement the paper by making the same assumptions as the paper and then following along step by step. You should challenge each and every assumption and statement. Also, think about how you would present the ideas they are presenting. You should be able to reconstruct the structure of the entire paper from memory and identify the inflection points of the paper.
